Do:
- Retreiving a record - give client their details and use on GUI (Put email at top of page)
- Encrypt data before sending & Decrypt data after receiving (Commands)
- Encrypt data stored in database

Ask:
- Can I use the "SMTPLib" module for sending the password reset emails
- Will the UDP Socket (Audio call) suffice for the peer-to-peer architecture requirement
